**Effective date:** December 28, 2025

MindFox stores your notes locally on your device by default.

If you have questions, contact: **Simon Yam** — **Simon.Yam227@gmail.com**

---

## Summary (plain English)

- MindFox lets you **record or type** a thought, then uses AI to generate a **summary, tags, action items, and sentiment**.
- Your saved notes (“Memories”) and “Digests” are **stored locally on your iPhone/iPad** (in Apple’s on-device app storage).
- When you use AI features, the text you submit (and the model’s output) is sent to **Google’s Gemini API** for processing.
- MindFox does **not** create user accounts, does **not** sell your data, and does **not** use ad tracking.

## Information MindFox uses

### 1) Microphone & speech recognition (optional)
If you choose voice capture, MindFox requests access to:
- **Microphone** (to record your speech)
- **Speech Recognition** (to transcribe speech into text)

MindFox uses Apple’s Speech framework to convert speech to text. Depending on your device and iOS settings, speech recognition may be processed **on-device** or may be processed by Apple to return a transcript. MindFox’s AI features use the **transcribed text**, not the raw audio.

### 2) Text you provide (“Thoughts”)
MindFox processes:
- Typed text you enter
- Transcripts produced from voice capture

This text is used to generate:
- A short **summary**
- **Tags**
- **Action items**
- **Sentiment**
- Optional multi-note **Digests**

### 3) App data stored on your device
MindFox stores the following **locally on your device**:
- Your original transcript/text
- AI-generated summary/tags/action items/sentiment
- Digests you generate (content + key insights)
- Task completion status (done/not done)

This information remains on your device until you delete it in the App or remove the App from your device.

### 4) Diagnostics
MindFox does not include third-party analytics SDKs. The App may write basic error messages to the device console for debugging.

## Third-party processing (Apple Speech / Google Gemini)

When you use:
- **Speech recognition**: your speech may be processed by Apple’s Speech framework to produce a transcript.
- **AI features** (**Capture**, **Re-run AI**, **Generate Digest**): the relevant text is sent to Google’s Gemini API and the model returns a structured result used to populate the App.

**Third-party protections:** Any third party that processes user data for MindFox (such as Apple Speech Recognition or Google Gemini) is expected to provide the **same or equal protection** of user data as stated in this policy and required by Apple’s App Review Guidelines. We use these services only to deliver the requested app functionality.

---

## Data sharing

MindFox shares data only in these situations:
1) **AI processing:** text is sent to Google Gemini when you request AI output.
2) **Speech recognition:** speech-to-text is handled by Apple’s Speech framework (processing may be on-device or by Apple depending on configuration).

MindFox does **not** sell your data. MindFox does **not** share data with advertisers. MindFox does **not** perform cross-app tracking.

---

## Data retention & deletion

### On-device retention (MindFox)
- **On-device storage:** Your saved notes and digests stay on your device until you delete them inside the App.
- **Deleting in the App:** When you delete a memory or digest, it is removed from local storage.
- **Deleting the App:** Removing the App from your device removes locally stored data in the App sandbox.

### Third-party retention (Apple / Google)
**Third parties:** Text sent to Apple for speech recognition and to Google Gemini for AI processing may be processed and retained according to their respective policies. For the **Gemini API**, Google may retain prompts and outputs for up to **55 days** for abuse monitoring. MindFox cannot directly delete data stored by Apple or Google; please refer to their policies.

## Revoke consent & request deletion

**Revoke consent:** You can stop voice capture by denying microphone/speech permissions, and you can stop AI processing by not using **Capture / Re-run AI / Generate Digest**.

**Request deletion:** You can delete notes and digests in-app at any time. Deleting the App removes locally stored data from your device. For data retained by Apple or Google as part of speech recognition or AI processing, deletion requests are governed by their policies (see links above).

---

## Security

MindFox uses Apple’s standard app sandboxing. Data is stored in the App’s private container on your device. No method of storage or transmission is 100% secure.

---

## Children’s privacy

MindFox is not directed to children under 13.

## Changes to this policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The “Effective date” above will reflect the latest version.
